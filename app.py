#Function to split the text into chunks

#The overlap helps retain context between chunks so important information isn't lost at the boundaries.
#When you cut the book into chunks, sometimes important sentences or ideas start at the end of one chunk 
#and continue in the next chunk. If you don’t include any overlapping text, the next chunk might miss the 
#start of that idea — causing loss of context.

#By overlapping, you include some text from the end of one chunk again at the start of the next chunk, so 
#the transition is smooth and the model keeps the connection between chunks.
#This overlap helps keep continuity.

#This function creates a question-answering chain using Google’s Gemini Pro chat model.

#It uses a prompt template that directs the model to answer questions based only on provided context.

#Temperature of 0.3 ensures somewhat predictable, reliable answers.

#Chain type "stuff" means the chain puts all context documents together as one chunk for the model to read
#before answering.

#Temperature ranges typically from 0 to 1 (sometimes higher).

#A low temperature (close to 0) makes the output very deterministic or predictable — the model tries to 
#give the most likely answer.

#A higher temperature (like 0.7 or above) makes the output more creative or varied — the model might 
#generate more diverse or imaginative answers.

#In your function, temperature=0.3 means the response will be relatively focused and less random, aiming 
#for clear, accurate answers.
